    <span class="textbox-left"><h3>Home Page</h3><p>The Home Page will often be your visitor's first experience of the website Ee wish to quickly communicate how the site will meet their needs through access to resources, access to the community, and inspiration through stories.</p><p> We use a large banner just under the navigation bar for images that evoke curiousity and interest, and a box that promotes a feature story to encourage further engagement. It also creates visual space between the navigation bar and the page content which reduces clutter and suggests intentional design. Quick access to resources is priority for your community, so we have added quicklinks to key resources and community interaction at the top of the main content as well as quicklinks to recent activity to give visitors a feel for how often the page is updated which is a signifier of how active the community is. A navigation bar at the top of the page adheres to familiar design conventions helping to improve navigability.</p></span><span class="textbox-right">                    <section class="gallery m-t-3">

    <span class="textbox-left"><h3>Category Pages</h3><p>Category pages, such as Kit Specific Guides and Personal Stories, will contain a number of links to content pages. Borrowing from the idea of magazines in a magazine rack, we will present these links as cards displayed in a grid pattern across the page. The simple, repetitive design reduces clutter and improves navigability with assistive technologies, while the large format of the cards allows for supporting images that evoke interest. The grid will be punctuated at intervals with calls to action such as the Newsletter Signup Form or submitting a story, and the design of this section will be visually distinct so as to not cause confusion. </p></span><span class="textbox-right">                    <section class="gallery m-t-3">

To the right of this block there will be a side bar that promotes feature articles to encourage further interaction and promote the site's additional content, and a recent activity feed so users can easily see and navigate to recent posts or updates. We commonly see this structure in content websites and users will be accustomed to this layout.
        
        As these pages are devoted to a specific purpose (such as describing a technique or display a user story) the larger proportion of the page is reserved </p></span><span class="textbox-right">                    <section class="gallery m-t-3">

    <h1>Colour Scheme</h1>
                        <div class="styleguide-layout">
    <span class="textbox-left"><p>The colour scheme is inspired by Christopher Walsh's <a href="https://www.saatchiart.com/en-cy/art/Painting-Khersones-Russian-Tall-Ship/597010/8351514/view?srsltid=AfmBOorgMwdbF865OR0x6nbELF2Rmw3wiZuXKDagLuCdZ-Qf6VZqJiCX">Kherson's, Russian Tall Ship</a>. While blue and white are synonymous with boating and nautical pursuits, this is also a colour scheme commonly found in corporate environments. To ensure the website feels welcoming and organic we have instead favoured greens which also serves to acknowledge the diversity of the sea's colours, metaphorically representing the diversity of our community. The tonal combinations can be used to create either cool or warm combinations as needed. The palette includes high contrast colours allowing for colour combinations to meet WCAG 2.2 guidelines. </p></span><span class="textbox-right"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/colours/Screenshot 2025-10-02 151627.png"></span></div>

<div class="styleguide-layout">
    <span class="textbox-left"><p>Cinzel has been chosen for the Page Title due to its nautical style design. As a serif font, it should be used sparingly and only at large sizes due to the decrease in readability as the size decreases. 
        The remaining headings and paragraphs use Inter due to its high web readability, even at small sizes, and its design compatibility with Cinzel.</p></span><span class="textbox-right"><div class="page-title">Page Title</div><h1>Heading 1</h1><h2>Heading 2</h2><h3>Heading 3</h3><p>Paragraph</p></span></div>
