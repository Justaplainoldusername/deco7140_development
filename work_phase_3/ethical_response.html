                        provides us with our guidelines for such design via the
                        three values of honesty, trustworthiness and respect. It
                        is through these three filters that we pass all our
                        client needs and design approaches to ensure that
                        ethical design is at the heart of every site we create.

                        including our feedback and recommendations for your
                        website.

                </div>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    These days users are no longer expected to be passive
                    consumers of a website's content. Instead they are invited
                    to interact with sites via logins, comments, contributions
                    and surveys, to name a few. In all instances, this leads to
                    a situation whereby the website owner possesses user data,
                    which requires careful consideration of the ethics of
                    obtaining and holding such data. As your website will be
                    collecting and holding user data to enable users to interact
                    with your site via the Newsletter Signup Form, we wish to
                    provide you with some recommendations that will help ensure
                    your website follows ethical design principles, and is an
                    honest, trustworthy and respectful place for your community
                    of users.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Ethical Reasoning</h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the project we were provided a
                    comprehensive brief which included the required fields for
                    the Newsletter Signup Form. We divided these fields into two
                    groups: those fields necessary for a user to successfully
                    sign-up to a newsletter (Full name, email), and additional
                    fields that are not required (remaining fields). From here
                    we assessed these groups using the three values of honesty,
                    trustworthiness and respect.
                </p>
                <h3>Honesty</h3>
                <p>
                    In the ACS Code of Professional Ethics, honesty includes the
                    practice of being open and truthful in all interactions, and
                    ensuring there is no representation of action, situation or
                    capability.
                </p>
                <p>Necessary Fields</p>
                <p>
                    These fields are the minimum required for users to sign up
                    to websites and newsletter subscriptions and users expect
                    that these fields will be requested of them for these
                    purposes. It is not necessary to explain why we are
                    requesting these details, therefore, we have assessed these
                    fields to be presented with openness and truthfulness, and
                    so long as this data is only used for the newsletter
                    subscription there is no misrepresentation of how the data
                    will be used.
                </p>
                <p>Additional Fields</p>
                <p>
                    These fields are not a requirement for a Newsletter Signup
                    Form and users will be unaccustomed to providing this
                    information for a newsletter signup. Additional information
                    as to why these fields are being included in this form, and
                    how the data will be used, is a prerequisite for this
                    section to be considered open, truthful and accurately
                    represented and therefore pass the Honesty value. The risks
                    associated with not including this additional information
                    include user distrust of the form, which will lead to lower
                    engagement and signups, and user distrust of the website as
                    a whole.
                </p>
                <h3>Trustworthiness</h3>
                <p>
                    Trustworthiness invites us to respect a person‚Äôs privacy and
                    confidentiality, and to act with integrity when holding
                    information or data related to a person.
                </p>
                <p>Necessary Fields</p>
                <p>
                    By collecting only the field required to subscribe a user to
                    a newsletter, we are proving to our user that we respect
                    their right to privacy and elevating our perception of
                    trustworthiness. By including a short statement near the
                    form announcing our intentions to use this daily for the
                    sole purpose of subsribing them to the newsletter, we will
                    further elevated this perception.
                </p>
                <p>Additional Fields</p>
                <p>
                    While these additional fields could provide useful data on
                    the lifestyles and preferences of your users, the
                    information users are being invited to share is private and
                    sensitive in nature. Special care must be taken to ensure
                    the user‚Äôs information is held with integrity, and their
                    privacy and confidentiality respected. Ensuring these fields
                    are optional (that is, the form can be submitted without
                    these fields being completed) allows users agency over what
                    information is provided through the form which respects
                    their privacy. Information on how data will be encrypted
                    both in transit and at rest should also be provided so that
                    users can be assured of their privacy and confidentiality.
                    De-linking identifiable user data (such as Full name) with
                    the additional fields also offers greater confidentiality of
                    the user data. The risks of making these additional fields
                    mandatory is low completion rates of the form, or inaccurate
                    data as users protect their privacy by providing false
                    information in order to complete the form. The risks of
                    making the additional fields optional is low completion
                    rates of these fields, lessening the scope of your data
                    collection. The risks of collecting and storing this data
                    are the breaches of privacy and confidentiality that may
                    occur with a data breach or misuse of the data, particularly
                    if the data has not been anonymised. We propose using
                    alternate methods of collecting this data (included in our
                    Recommendations) that will enable these fields to pass the
                    Trustworthiness value.
                </p>
                <p>Respect</p>
                <p>
                    In the ACS Code of Professional Ethics, Respect asks that we
                    identify and mitigate risks to others associated with our
                    work.
                </p>
                <p>Necessary Fields</p>
                <p>
                    Even though it is standard practice to request a user‚Äôs name
                    and email address for website logins and newsletter signup
                    forms, there is still a risk associated with collecting and
                    holding this data. These risks include data breaches that
                    may result in unsolicited email to the user, or misuse of
                    the newsletter subscription list through internal practices
                    or sale of the list to other entities. As we cannot
                    eliminate these feels from the form, mitigating these risks
                    includes hardening the data storage against data breaches,
                    adhering to the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A01214/latest/versions"
                        >Spam Act 2003</a
                    >, defining and following internal processes to ensure this
                    data is used respectfully, and only allowing the data to be
                    used for its intended process. With these strategies defined
                    and followed, these fields will pass the Respect value.
                </p>
                <p>Additional Fields</p>
                <p>
                    The field Sexuality falls within what the Privacy Act 1988
                    considers to be sensitive information. Sensitive information
                    is afforded a higher level of protection than personal data
                    due to its sensitive nature and the potential for misuse of
                    this data to cause serious harm to the individual. In the
                    event of a data breach, data linking an identifiable
                    individual with their sexual orientation or practices could
                    greatly impact their quality of life, including their
                    ability to live in or travel to certain countries or their
                    ability to access adequate and appropriate care. The
                    remaining fields are considered Personal data, which
                    requires less protection but still carries risk for the
                    user. Malicious actors adept at social engineering may gain
                    access to an individual‚Äôs banking accounts with name,
                    occupation, and credit limits alone. Additionally, data on a
                    user‚Äôs takeaway dining preferences could be used to target
                    advertising campaigns to encourage or exacerbate existing
                    behavioural patterns for commercial benefit. To mitigate
                    these risks, we propose using alternate methods of
                    collecting this data (included in our Recommendations) that
                    will enable these fields to pass the Respect value.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Recommendations</h2>
                <p>
                    To minimise risk to our users and maximise the ethical
                    design of the website, we recommend that the Newsletter
                    Signup Form contains only those fields necessary to function
                    (full name and email address). This ensures that the data
                    you retain is of the lowest risk should a breach occur, and
                    conforms with what users expect of a signup form elevating
                    user trust and website usability.

                    We appreciate your desire to collect data from your users
                    that better enables you to understand your community. For
                    this, we recommend engaging the services of
                    third-party-providers whose speciality is in market research
                    and community surveys. Reputable companies in this arena are
                    adept at structuring surveys to capture the data that suits
                    your purposes, can anonymise data to ensure user privacy and
                    confidentiality, and store data in locations hardened
                    against cyberattacks and data breaches.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    We understand that not every organisation has the budget to
                    engage Market Researchers to conduct community surveys. In
                    these instances, we recommend taking the approach of an
                    in-house, optional, anonymous user survey through either the
                    website, or a lower-cost provider such as Survey Monkey. Key
                    considerations when taking this approach are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A clear strategy as to what needs to be achieved through
                        the collection of this data, and what questions need to
                        be asked to achieve this goal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Openness as to why the data is being collected. Users
                        are often enthusiastic about engaging in surveys when
                        there is a high level of existing trust with the website
                        or brand and they know how their data will be used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secure data storage that is hardened against cyber
                        attacks and established policies on how a data breach
                        will be handled and communicated to those affected
                        including how to engage cybersecurity lawyers in the
                        event of a ransomware attack. When choosing cloud
                        storage, it is important that you are familiar with the
                        privacy laws of the country where the data will be
                        stored to ensure it meets with Australian standards.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For many clients we found that the cost of developing the
                    form in-house with adequate data storage and protection
                    against cyberattacks, was comparable with a Market Research
                    approach, and the peace-of-mind of using the latter was
                    worth the additional expense.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Can we redirect the Newsletter Signup Form to a third party
                    that can collect the additional fields as well?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, this is technically possible. However, we encourage our
                    clients to keep the Newsletter Signup Form simple and within
                    the website rather than navigating the user away from the
                    site. Our reasoning behind this is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Trust. When users have established a level of trust with
                        your website, their barriers to submitting data to a
                        form are lowered. Redirecting a user to a form that is
                        outside your site requires that they re-establish trust
                        with this new platform. If this trust is not
                        established, the user will abandon the form.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Branding. Branding is about consistency and trust. While
                        the user is within your website, you have full control
                        over the branding and appearance of the site. However,
                        an external site may not offer the same flexibility, and
                        your branding and imagery may not be consistent with
                        your primary site. Again, this impacts trust.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Lowering user engagement with your site. Generally, as
                        website owners, we want our users to be on our site for
                        as long as possible. Directing them to an external site
                        may end their session on yours, whereas keeping them
                        within the site ensures they are continuing to engage
                        with your content.
                    </li>
