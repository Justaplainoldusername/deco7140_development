    <h1>How was Generation AI Used?</h1>
    <p>Four AI platforms were used to build this website. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ChatGPT</li>
                <li>StockCake</li>
        <li>Adobe Colour</li>
        <li>FireFly Image (Adobe Photoshop Beta)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>ChatGPT</h3>
</h3>
<p>ChatGPT was the most intensively used AI Platform in this project. It was used to generate font suggestions, troubleshooting, code generation and textual content.</p>
<p>To generate font suggestions, the AI was asked "Which fonts are synonymous with nautical themes and water travel?" and then "I would like you to suggest a few heading/paragraph combinations for a website. Readability is important.". After viewing these fonts and choosing Cinzel as a page-title font, I then prompted the AI for a compatible san-serif font, however I ended up choosing a different sans-serif font specifically for Cinzel than was suggested due to a card template in Figma that acheived my desired aesthetic. </p>

<p>ChatGPT was regularly used for troubleshooting due to its fast processing, pattern recognition, and knowledge of css, html and js conventions. One example includes the prompt "How do I stop my < body > content from appear behind my navigation bar in < header >< /header >"  The AI was able to produce resolutions to issues I was having which enabled me to focus less time on troubleshooting bugs and more time on design.</p>

<p>Some code generation was performed by ChatGPT which I then adapted and refined using W3 Schools and my developing understand of css and html. This includes css and html for the navigation cards/buttons, and the website banner.</p>

<p>While I prefer to write all text content myself without AI assistance, for this project I requested some text assistance from ChatGPT. This includes the paragraph that was not recommended in the Language and Tone guide for Representation and the Language and Tone guide for Inclusivity. The prompts were "Rewrite this text using lots of nautical metaphors and language targeted at men: "Welcome to the CCI Model Boat Building Community. We're glad you're here! Feel free to browse through our Resources to help your next project, read a wonderful Story from our community, or if you need some advice reach out to our active community of builders through the Discussion Board. We have all you need to get excited for your next build." and "Write a guide on how to use PVA Glue at a year 7-9 reading level, and at a doctorate level." respectively.</p>

<h3>StockCake</h3>
<p>After experimenting with some AI Image Generators I settled on StockCake that already had a small library of model boat building images representing diversity. This AI was used to generate most of the website images, including all those containing representations of humans. An example of the type of prompt used is "A group of four men and three women aged from fifty upwards all standing around a workbench at a local community woodworking shed. They are looking at a model ship as the person in the centre of the group ties a complex knot.</p>

<h3>Adobe Colours</h3>
<p>Wanting to avoid the stereotypical blue/white nautical colour scheme and inspired by the Christopher Walsh's <a href="https://www.saatchiart.com/en-cy/art/Painting-Khersones-Russian-Tall-Ship/597010/8351514/view?srsltid=AfmBOorgMwdbF865OR0x6nbELF2Rmw3wiZuXKDagLuCdZ-Qf6VZqJiCX">Khersons, Russian Tall Ship</a> I download a snip of the image and uploaded it to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/"> Adobe Colour</a> which resulted in a palette of five swatches that I could adapt by changing the "color mood" and adjusting the location of the pointers. </p>

<h3>FireFly Image (Adobe Photoshop Beta)</h3>
<p>Using FireFly Image in Adobe Photoshop Beta, I generated the current banner image by uploading Walsh's image as a guide and adding the five hex color values I had uncovered from the image to generate an image of a "tallship out at sea amongst waves and seagulls". The resulting image was then lengthened to create a maximum-width banner using Photoshop's inbuilt generative fill.</p>
<h1>How did AI support learning</h1>
<p>ChatGPT was incredibly helpful in troubleshooting code. Not only was it able to resolve issues, but it clearly explained what was happening so that I would be better equipped to troubleshoot the same issue in the future. The time saved by requesting troubleshooting assistance allowed me to spend more time developing my approach to design.</p>
<p>Using ChatGPT to write content enabled me to product text in a different voice to my own. Having only rudimentary knowledge of nautical terms and clich√©s and no scientific knowledge of PVA glue, the paragraph produced for the Language and Tone guides was far more convincing than if I had been the author. It allowed me to produce content quickly and with versatility.
    <p>As with Work Phase 2, using ChatGPT to create css and html for various elements of the website that I could develop quickly with my current skillset was beneficial. However I also found myself reusing elements from earlier work phases, such as the text value highlights and cards, rather than asking ChatGPT to reproduce them. By using this method and referring to W3 Schools I was able to adapt this code to suit my preferred aesthetic and functionality. This gave me a greater sense of control and authority over my code, and I feel I understands these sections of the code better than that generated mostly or partly by AI.</p>
    <p>Using AI to create images for my website enabled me to quickly build content without concern for author permissions (all images are either Public Domain or generated under my paid subscription with StockCake and Adobe) and allowed me to adapt and customise images quickly to suit my precise needs. Quick generation of this content enabled me to start experimenting with image tags and css alterations sooner. It also meant that I was working with visually pleasing images, which produces the psychological effect of pride in one's project and encouraged me to continue refining my website's aesthetics.</p>
 <h1>Critically Evaluate AI's effectiveness</h1>
    <p>ChatGPT remains highly effective at generating code and providing troubleshooting tips so long as the prompt is precise and detailed. Asking for specific minimum screen sizes for @media queries and providing defined variables help the AI produce html and css that can be easily copy and pasted into the project without much editing. However, often it is too pre-emptive of needs, even when it has been asked to provide only the bare minimum, so copying code without assessing each line will likely result in unnecessary or unused lines of copy, over-complicating the project. </p>
    <p>For the first time in this course I encountered a genuine and frustrating limitation of GenerativeAI. When using StockCake to produce images that represent the diversity of the community, I couldn't successfully produce an image of a physical disability that would require a builder to adjust their technique or tools. To be more specific, I wanted to represent a builder who didn't have use of their arms and were therefore painting a model using a paintbrush held in their mouth, which is a perfectly reasonable way to navigate this challenge. Regardless of how I arranged the prompt, it seemed that certain hierachies exist in a GenAI's understanding of our world, and when "painting" or "paintbrush" was included in the prompt, the generated image defaulted to use of the subject's hands. Including in the prompt how the arms should "hang by their side" or "be under the bench" didn't change the result and I couldn't find an image that realistically and ethically represented disablity and model boat building.</p>
