                    <p>Language choice and tone is an important aspect of community representation. We recommend keeping the language of the site neutral in terms of gender, age and ethnic background, friendly and welcoming, and practical, much like the language used in a boat building kit. We shall focus on what unites the community, rather than segments it, by referring to our members as "Our community", "Our builder community", or "our builders".</p>
                    <p>When referring to an identifiable individual, such as an historical figure or a contributer, we shall use their chosen or documented pronouns. Where there is ambiguity, we shall use the gender neutral they/them.</p>
                   
                    <p>While it may be tempting to include nautical clich√©s such as "Ahoy Matey" in our text, we respect that our community is diverse with many hailing from non-nautical backgrounds. While some may indulge in puns and clich√©s, others may find this tone restrictive and unrepresentative of their experience of boat building. For those individuals that wish to express their appreciation for nautical clich√©s, the interactive elements of the site, such as the forums and comments sections, and the community lead Stories section will provide these opportunities and their unique voices will contribute to the rich diversity of the website while still provided a neutral platform for the other voices within the community to be heard.</p></span><span class="textbox-right">

                    <p>We anticipate that our community will have a range of reading levels and proficiency with the English language. To ensure our website is inclusive of all, we recommend using language that written clearly and simply. According to <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Work Phase 2 > Accessibility Assessment > Success Criterion 3.1.5 Reading Level">WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 3.1.5</span>, this is considered to be at a reading level at or below lower secondary education level (generally 7-9 years of school).</p>
                    <p>Where language exceeds that of lower secondary, users must be able to acquire a simplified version of the text. This may be relevant where community explanations are pitched to fellow experts, or when community Stories are targetted toward a high level of sophistication with English.</p>

                            <p class="p-rd">Polyvinyl acetate (PVA) adhesive is a synthetic thermoplastic polymer emulsion, widely utilized in porous substrate bonding due to its versatility, non-toxicity, and water solubility prior to curing. Its application involves mechanical interlocking and hydrogen bonding rather than covalent adhesion, making surface preparation critical for optimal bond integrity.</p>
                            <h3>Lower Secondary School Level</h3>
                            <p>PVA glue (short for polyvinyl acetate) is a white, sticky glue used for wood, paper, cardboard, fabric, and many school projects. It dries clear and is easy to clean up with water.</p>

                                        <h3>Sensitive Terms</h3>
                    <p>We appreciate that the language of history has not always been sensitive to diversity, with sexism, racism and ableism often playing key roles in historic events. Our community have expressed interest in the historical accuracy of nautical-life and there will, on occasion, be terms used that are historically accurate for the era that would be considered insensitive or offensive today. To allow for historically accurate expression while still being sensitive to the diverse community, texts containing such terms or ideas will be annotated to provide a forewarning to concerned readers, historical context and reiterate our modern values of inclusivity and respect of diversity. </p>
                <p>We hope that in taking this approach we not only show respect, but help to educate our community on the views of the past that may still impact on the quality of lives of people today.</p>

                    <p>Wherever elements have the same appearance they will share the same behaviour. For example, if a feature looks like a card, then it will display all the same characteristics and functionality of other cards on the site, such as hover effects and hyperlinking.</p>
                    <p>In the example, the second card does not have the same hover or focus features of the first, but when clicked on still operates as a hyperlink. This behaviour is confusing and should be avoided.</p>

                <p>One of the clearly stated requirements for your website is to maintain it as a non-commercial space. This value is supported by the community, who have expressed need for <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Work Phase 2 > User Stories > Kelly > How much I spend">discretion surrounding the costs</span> associated with the hobby.  </p>

                    <p>All images should be free from indicators of cost (such as price tags) and preferably brand, although we accept that certain brands will be preferred by users and recommended in the Discussion Board or other Resources.</p>

                                        <h3>Language and Tone</h3>
                    <p>Wherever possible, language is to be brand neutral so as not to create the perception of brand preference or alliance. Situations where this does not apply includes references to specific kits by make and model for the purposes of collating kit specific resources, and in the Discussion Board where users are welcome to express their preference for certain brands so long as their interest is not commercial. </p>
                    <p>References to costs or values should be avoided, however advice on how to reduce costs, such a tool or material alternatives, is strongly encouraged.</p>
