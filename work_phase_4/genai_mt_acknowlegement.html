                <div id="community-list"></div>
                <h3>How was Generative AI Used?</h3>
                <p>Three AI platforms were used to build this website. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ChatGPT</li>
                    <li>StockCake</li>
                    <li>FireFly Image (Adobe Photoshop Beta)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>ChatGPT</h4>
                <p>ChatGPT was the most intensively used AI Platform in this project. It was used to generate html, css, and js for components not used in previous work phases, troubleshooting code, suggesting accessibility and ARIA improvements, and generating content including text and images</p>
                <p>The navigation bar is one example of where ChatGPT was used to generate html, css, and js simultaneously. Several attempts were made before the code operated in the desired manner, and some manual adjustments were required before I was satisfied with the result. It also generated js code to format the “days since” element in the Comments section.
</p>
<p>ChatGPT was also used to troubleshoot code. For example, I was having difficulty with the cards in the sidebar overlapping the boundary of the sidebar as the view-width approached (but was larger than) 768px. I pasted my css into the chat and ChatGPT suggested a fix that worked immediately. 
</p>
<p>In order to improve accessibility on my site, I pasted my page code into chatGPT and asked for recommendations on how to better use semantic html and ARIA labels. It made recommendations such as replacing &lt;heading&gt; with &lt;h2&gt;, wrapping the quicklinks list in the footer with a &lt;nav&gt; tag and aria-label=”Footer”, and pointing out where my use of semantics was already correct. 
</p>
<p>As always, ChatGPT was great at generating large amounts of text content. In order to save time, and have a voice other than my own in the website, I had ChatGPT produce the content for <i>Sydney Sails</i> based on a prompt of Bob’s age, background, sharing his hobby with his granddaughter and the types of phrases he would likely use (“she’s dead-keen on model building just like her old pop here”). The AI produced a personality rich story that had a lovely quote I was able to use for the hero-box. It also successfully generated some closeup images of model boats when StockCake was not achieving good results. 
</p>
<h4>StockCake
</h4><p>I built upon the library of model boat building images from Workphase 3 to create an image of Bob and his granddaughter, closeup images of various model components, and the banner image. I used prompts such as “A caucasian man in his 70s working on a model boat with his teenage Vietnamese granddaughter” to deliberately inject representation and diversity into the images. For the closeup images I used specific boat terms to trigger a focus on the correct part of the model, such as “hull”, “deck”, and “rigging” with mixed results. 
</p>
<h4>FireFly Image (Adobe Photoshop Beta)
</h4>
<p>StockCake was limited on the width of the banner image it could produce, so I used FireFly Image’s (Adobe Photoshop Beta) generative fill to extend the image using prompts such as “continue to the corner of the wall and add a bookshelf and a painting of a yacht” which successfully produced a longer image that looked cohesive with the original. 
</p>
<h3>How did AI support learning
</h3>
<p>In addition to using AI to create and troubleshoot code, I used it to explain snippets of code to me, which was especially helpful when working with the js, the least familiar of the three languages. Troubleshooting with genAI also enabled me to later recognise similar issues in my code and resolve it manually without resorting to assistance. 
</p>
<p>As with earlier workphases, it enabled me to produce more beautiful designs in a shorter timeframe, which increased my satisfaction with the project and encouraged me to work longer and harder toward the final product. It made creating a great website feel achievable. 
</p>
<p>The code produced by ChatGPT far exceeds my current ability. At first this was overwhelming, and I felt the website was not within my control. However with time, persistence and experimentation I was able to better understand the code and know which elements to adjust and which to remove completely. 
</p>
<p>As with Workphase 3, using StockCake to generate images meant that I had a library of visually appealing, inclusive, royalty-free images that were pleasing to work with and helped improve the site’s aesthetics. 
</p>
<h3>Critically Evaluate AI's effectiveness
</h3>
<p>As always, ChatGPT was effective at troubleshooting code and providing advice. However, its responses are verbose, and often when I am seeking a short answer I find the information I need gets lost within the additional suggestions the AI provides. Asking for a short answer helps this, but one needs to remember to add this to the prompt else ChatGPT will provide more than is required which is time consuming to sort through. 
</p>
<p>ChatGPT struggled to provide the style of Navigation Bar I wanted and it took several prompts and manual edits to produce the result I was after. Even now I still feel that improvements could be made to how the navigation bar operates but the complexity of the component, and fear of making a difficult-to-revert change at this late stage, prevents me from experimenting with it any further. 
</p>
<p>StockCake again proved to have limitations. To anyone who has worked with a model boat the images look incredibly artificial. For example, the lines in the rigging image are nonsensical. It also refused to produce an image of “dead-eyes”  which are a genuine component of model boats, on the grounds of it being a sensitive topic. While the images of people are remarkably beautiful and realistic for a computer generated image, they are still obviously artificial and I would not suggest that a company use images of this quality if they wish to be perceived as legitimate. 
</p>
<p>In general, GenAI allowed me to create beautiful results quickly without knowing much code. However, without making efforts to learn this code properly I will be forever reliant on AI to produce results. While time has been saved in the short-term, it may be more efficient in the long-term if I thoroughly learn these languages so that I am more able to experiment, break “rules” and add that spark of human-creativity that GenAI is yet to develop. 
</p>
<p>In retrospect, had I had the time to work through this course without the use of Generative AI I would have preferred to have taken that path. One reason for this is that I want my code to feel as though it has come from my slow and considered approach to design. There is an art to beautiful code, and I would like to own each line as my own creation, not that of an AI. Second, the environmental impact of using Generative AI is of concern to me; the learnings I have garnered from using AI have been great, however, it should be weighed against the environmental impact of each search.
