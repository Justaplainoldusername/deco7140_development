            <section>
<p>As ethical webdesigners, we have undertaken an Ethical Assessment of the website proposal. We have identified only one area of the site that requires revision: The Newsletter Signup Form. These are our findings and recommendations:</p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p><strong>Collection of unnecessary information</strong></p>
<p>Ordinarily, the data required to signup to a newsletter is limited to Name (or First Name and Surname) and email address. These two/three fields are sufficient to be added to the newsletter database, and users are accustomed to sharing this level of data with entities and online.</p>
<p>Our client is interested in collecting additional data that users will find unfamiliar in a newsletter signup form. Deviating from what is familiar may have the unintended result of lowering user trust and users may opt to forego the newsletter in favour of protecting their data. It may also lower their trust in the website as a whole. </p>
<p><strong>Collection of Sensitive Information</strong></p>
<p>Our client wishes to collect data on the users' sexuality in the Newsletter Signup Form. This is considered Sensitive Information by the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information">OAIC</a>. Sensitive Information requires additional privacy protection as it has the capacity to cause harm to an individual if misused. We do not have information on how this data will be stored, whether it will be encrypted (both in transit and at rest), and whether it will be linked to an identifiable person.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of data breach</strong></p>
<p>Should a data breach occur against the Newsletter Signup Database, because the client has collected a number of data items against the user there is greater potential for harm than if only name and email had been collected.</p>
<p>In many countries, a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is a legal issue. Homosexuality and transgender identification can lead to arrest, incarceration and even the death penality. A data breach that links an identifiable person with their sexuality or gender identity could endanger them, or prevent them from travelling to or through risky areas.</p>
<p>In areas where homosexuality or transgender identification is not illegal, there is still potential for harm due to societal, cultural or religious norms. </p>
<p>Identity theft is also a very real threat. Our client is collecting personal financial information from its website users that could enable malicious actors to commit identify theft or fraud. Even if the user's card number or provider is not provided, knowing details such a occupation and credit card limits can help malicious actors who are adept at social engineering scams.</p>
<p><strong>Selling of data to third parties</strong></p>
<p>The selling of data to third parties is a common practice with broad ethical implications. In some cases, data can be used to target vital resources to users with a genuine need. To the same effect, however, it can be used to target vulnerable users to increase their consumption or reliance on a resource. As an example, a user that has indicated a high monthly spend on takeaway food may have their data used by fast food companies to target advertising to that user.</p>
<p><strong>Absence of intent</strong></p>
<p>Our client has not indicated their motivations for collecting this data or how it will be stored and used, and transparency is vital to a perception of trustworthiness. The client has not indicated whether or not these fields will be optional or mandatory, so for the recommendations we will assume that it is our client's preference that they are mandatory fields.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p><strong>Reconsider</strong></p>
<p>Our first recommendation to our client is to reconsider the need to collect this data. Questions we would like the client to consider include "How will collecting this data improve the lives or experiences of our users?", "What problem are we trying to solve for our users?" and "Is this our problem to solve, or is there someone/somewhere else better equipped to handle this problem?"</p>
<p>For example, it may have been identified that the target community contains a disproportionately high number of vulnerable members with risky spending habits that need better financial literacy support. Collecting financial data may be a means of identifying at-risk members who can benefit from targeted support. This adds validity to the inclusion of these questions in the Newsletter Signup Form.</p>
<p>If, on greater reconsideration, there is no greater good for the user in collecting this data, we recommend reducing the newsletter signup form to <italics>First Name</italics>, <italics>Surname</italics>, and <italics>Email address</italics>.</p>
<p><strong>Reassess</strong></p>
<p>If collection of the data has been deemed necessary and ethical, our next recommendation is to assess whether fields in the Newsletter Signup Form can be removed or revised</p>
<p>Using the example above, if the goal is to identify users with low financial literacy, replace the questions regarding spending habits, monthly takeaway spend, and credit card quantity and limits, with a self-reporting field such as "Do you ever feel that you need assistance managing your finances?". This question may still invoke resistance from the user, however it is more direct in its intention and allows the user more agency over how they wish to be represented in the data they are providing.
<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
<p>If the newsletter signup form has been reconsidered and reassessed, and still deemed to be necessary, we recommend practicing transparency as to why this information is being collected.  This information will need to be made readily available to users both prior to, during, and after completion of the form and should contain the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>Why the data is being collected.</li>
        <li>How the data will be used.</li>
        <li>How the data will be protected from misuse or breaches.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Optional Participation</strong></p>
<p>Optional participation in the collection of this data would involve setting all fields other than <italics>Full name</italics> and <italics>Email address</italics> to optional rather than required. This gives users control over how much data they provide. The positive outcome of this approach is that we will see fewer abandoned forms, however there will be incompleteness of data as users fill out those sections they are comfortable with and leave others blank. </p>
<p><strong>Optional & Anonymous Participation</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, if this data is necessary, we would like for it to be collected both optionally and anonymously. This ensures that users have consented to providing the information, and that their answers cannot be linked to their identity should a data breach occur. There are third-party providers who specialise in such data collection, ensuring complete anonymity, safe data storage practices, and data analysis. The data will be collected independently of the newsletter signup form. By delinking the data collection survey from the newsletter signup, we will also be reducing frequency of incompleted forms when users are unwilling to provide personal or sensitive data. </p>
