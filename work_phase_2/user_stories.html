            <section class="interview">
                <h5 class="user-name">Bob
                </h5>
                <p class="initial-prompt mt-1">Bob is a 72 year-old retiree and ex mechanical engineer. He started building model ships in his late fifties and has built several models from various companies. He is currently working on the Le Superbe by Mantua Models. His eyesight is not very good, and he struggles with the fiddly rigging knots, but he loves the process of building beautiful models.</p>
                <p class="question mt-3">When you go online to find information about model ship building, what types of interactions or information are you looking for?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">When I go online looking for information about model ship building, I’m usually after a few key things:</div>
                <div class="response mt-3">Clear, Practical Instructions – The manuals that come with these kits aren’t always the easiest to follow, so I like finding step-by-step guides, diagrams, or videos that show exactly how something should be done. A close-up photo of a knot or a rigging line is worth a thousand words to me.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3">Tips from Other Builders – I enjoy reading <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model ship builder I want a forum so that I can learn from other builders.">forum threads</span> or watching YouTube builders who have tackled the same kit. Someone will always have worked out a clever workaround for a fiddly bit. For example, I’ve picked up tricks on using small clamps, tweezers, or even dental tools to make life easier.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3">Solutions for Common Problems – Since my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, I’m especially interested in how others deal with tiny parts, fine thread, or painting details. Anything about magnifiers, lighting setups, or alternative techniques helps me a lot.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3">Historical Accuracy vs. Artistic Choice – I like learning about how the real ships looked, but I’m also keen to see how other modelers balance strict accuracy with what simply looks good. Sometimes I take comfort in knowing it’s fine if not every rope is in the perfect place.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3">Community & Encouragement – Honestly, I enjoy just chatting with fellow modelers. Sharing progress photos, getting a “well done” on a tricky bit, or commiserating over tangled rigging—it makes the hobby feel less solitary.</div>
                <div class="response met-3">So, in short: I’m looking for practical guidance, shared experience, and a bit of camaraderie</div>
                
                <p class="question mt-3">Is there any information, or are there any experiences, about model ship building that you have difficulty finding online?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">
                    Yes, there are definitely a few gaps I’ve noticed when I go digging around online:

                </div>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Kit-Specific Guidance – You can usually find a build log or two for the popular kits, but sometimes with the older Mantua or less common ships, there’s very little. I’d love to see more detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs tailored to the exact kit I’m working on. The instructions that come in the box can be vague, and not every modeler documents their build.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Close-Up Demonstrations of Rigging Knots – I struggle with these the most. Plenty of resources explain the theory of rigging, but very few give crisp, zoomed-in photos or videos showing exactly how to tie the knot, tighten it, and secure it without making a mess of the thread. <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As someone with poor eyesight, I need high resolution images so that I can clearly see how to do certain tasks.">With my eyesight,</span> I need that level of clarity.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Tool Adaptations for Older Builders – There’s loads of advice on tools in general, but very little about adapting them for shaky hands, stiff fingers, or less-than-perfect eyesight. For example, I’d like to see more tips on modified jigs, clamps, or even ergonomic tweezers.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Historical Context for Specific Details – Sometimes I wonder why a ship was rigged a certain way, or what purpose a certain feature served. The big picture history is out there, but the fine details behind design choices aren’t always explained clearly.</div>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Troubleshooting Common Mistakes – Everyone makes them—rigging lines slackening, hull planking gaps, paint bleeding—but the online advice tends to show perfect outcomes. I’d really value guides that say, “If this goes wrong, here’s how to fix it.”</div>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">So, in short: it’s not that there isn’t information, it’s just that it’s often scattered, or presented at a level that assumes perfect eyes and steady hands—which isn’t my reality anymore.</div>
                <p class="question mt-3">Tell me about a positive experience you’ve had either online or offline when interacting with other model ship builders? What do you think made it positive?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3">
                <p>One of the most positive experiences I’ve had was on a model ship forum when I was wrestling with the rigging on my Sovereign of the Seas. I’d posted a photo of my tangled lines and admitted I was about ready to pack the whole thing back in its box. <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model builder, I need quick responses from other builders so that I can continue to work on my build.">Within a day</span>, three or four fellows had chimed in—not just with encouragement, but with very specific advice. One chap even sketched out a little diagram showing how he secured his deadeyes without everything slipping loose. Another suggested a simple trick of waxing the thread with beeswax before tying, which made the knots grip better.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response mt-3">
                <p>What made it positive wasn’t just the practical help—it was the tone. No one made me feel silly for struggling, even though I’m sure they’d tied a thousand more knots than me. Instead, it felt like they genuinely wanted me to succeed and enjoy the build.</p>
                    </div>
                <div class="response mt-3">
                <p>I’ve had a similar experience offline at a local hobby club. An older gentleman brought along his half-finished model, and we ended up comparing notes over coffee. We swapped little tricks—he showed me how he uses tiny bulldog clips as temporary hands, and I showed him how I make a jig from scrap wood. That sort of camaraderie, where we’re both learning from each other, is very satisfying.</p> 
                </div>
                <div class="response mt-3">
                <p>So, to me, what makes these experiences positive is the sense of belonging and mutual respect. It’s not just about building ships—it’s about sharing the journey, frustrations and all, with people who understand why we fuss over tiny ropes and planks.</p>
                    </div>
            <p class="question mt-3">When you are looking for resources related to model ship building, which device do you primarily use, and how to you use it?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">Most of the time I use my laptop when I’m looking for model ship resources. The <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model builder, I need to use a bigger screen so that I can see detail while I am do the build.">bigger screen</span> makes a world of difference for my eyes, especially when I’m trying to zoom in on photos of rigging or read long build logs. I’ll often keep the laptop open on the workbench (a safe distance from the glue, mind you!) so I can glance at instructions or a forum post while I’m working.</div>    
            <div class="response mt-3">I do also use my tablet on occasion, mainly for watching YouTube videos. It’s handy because I can prop it up right in front of me while I’m tying knots and pause or rewind as needed. But for searching forums or downloading PDFs of instructions, the laptop is easier to navigate.</div>    
            <div class="response mt-3">I hardly ever use my phone for model ship stuff—the screen’s just too small, and I end up squinting or missing details. For me, bigger screens and the ability to zoom in are essential.</div>
            <p class="question mt-3">What is something you wish that non model ship builders knew about you and your hobby?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">I think I’d like people to understand that building model ships isn’t just “playing with little boats.” It’s a real craft that takes patience, planning, and a steady hand—like a blend of engineering, carpentry, and art all rolled into one.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">I wish folks knew how much satisfaction there is in the process, not just the finished model. To me, every tiny plank or knot is a little victory. Even if I only manage to get two or three parts done in an afternoon, that’s time well spent. It’s about the journey as much as the ship on the shelf.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">And I’d want people to realize that for someone my age, it’s not just a pastime—<span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As an older person, I need resources that help me continue my hobby so that I can remain healthy.">it keeps my mind sharp</span> and my hands working. Some people do crossword puzzles; I rig ships. It gives me a sense of accomplishment and, frankly, a bit of pride when visitors see the detail and care that’s gone into something I’ve built.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">So I suppose I’d want non–model ship builders to know that this hobby is more than fiddling—it’s creativity, history, patience, and craftsmanship all tied together.</div>            
        <p class="question mt-3">Is there anything about your hobby of model ship building that you feel needs to be kept confidential or discrete?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">No, not really. I’m quite open about my ship building. In fact, I rather enjoy talking about it when people show an interest. I’ve got models displayed around the house, and I’m proud of them.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">That said, there are a couple of things I tend to keep a bit quieter about:</div>
            <div class="response mt-3"><ul><li>The Cost – These kits, tools, and materials aren’t cheap, and unless someone is in the hobby, they might not understand why I’d spend that much on “just a model.” My wife sometimes raises an eyebrow when a new box arrives, so I don’t always volunteer the full price tag.</li></ul></div>
            <div class="response mt-3"><ul><li>The Mistakes – I don’t usually tell people how many times I’ve had to redo a section, or how many hours I’ve spent untangling a bit of rigging. From the outside, folks just see the polished end result, and I’m happy to let them think it all came together smoothly.</li></ul></div>
            <div class="response mt-3">But as for secrecy—no, I don’t see the need. It’s a wholesome, rewarding hobby, and I’d rather share it than hide it.</div>

                <section class="interview">
                <h5 class="user-name">Kelly
                </h5>
                <p class="initial-prompt mt-1">Kelly is 41. Her Dad was a sailor, and she has always romanticised sailing and tailships. Recently, on a whim, she purchased the Occre Albatros and has started to build it. This is her first model, so she doesn’t have many of the tools that experienced builders use and she is having to learn the building techniques, and the ship part names, from scratch.</p>
                <p class="question mt-3">When you go online to find information about model ship building, what types of interactions or information are you looking for?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">When I go online, I’m usually looking for things that are really beginner-friendly. Since this Albatros is my first build, half the time I don’t even know the names of the parts I’m working with, so clear explanations and lots of pictures are important.</div>
                    <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3"><span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model builder, I want access to Step-by-Step guides so that I can build my models more accurately.">Step-by-Step Guides</span> – Instructions that break down what to do in plain English, ideally with photos or videos. The kit manual sometimes assumes I know more than I do.</div>
<div class="response mt-3"><span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a beginner model builder, I want access to advice on tool alternatives so that I can save money.">Tool Alternatives</span> – Because I don’t have a workshop full of gadgets, I want to know what I can improvise with things around the house. For example, can I use regular clothes pegs instead of fancy clamps?</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Beginner Terminology – <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a beginner builder, I need access to glossaries or diagrams so that I can understand what I'm doing.">Glossaries or diagrams</span> that show me what each part of the ship is called. If someone says “mast cap” or “deadeye,” I need a visual to connect the dots.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Encouragement & Real Experiences – I like reading blogs or watching YouTubers who admit when they’ve made mistakes and explain how they fixed them. It makes me feel less alone when I get stuck.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Community Interaction – <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a beginner builder, I need a non-critical place to seek help so that I don't feel embarassed.">A friendly place</span> to ask “silly” questions without feeling embarrassed. I don’t need expert-level debates about historical rigging right now—I just need someone to say, “Yes, glue that bit first, and here’s why.”</div>
<div class="response mt-3">For me, it’s less about perfection and more about learning the ropes step by step while enjoying the romance of building a tall ship.</div>

                <p class="question mt-3">Is there any information, or are there any experiences, about model ship building that you have difficulty finding online?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">oh, absolutely. Since I’m just starting out, there are a few things that are really hard to find online:</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Beginner-Friendly Explanations – Most tutorials seem aimed at people who already know a lot. I often struggle to find instructions that explain not just how to do something, but why it’s done that way. For example, the logic behind rigging order or how to avoid tangles.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Tool Substitutes for Beginners – I don’t have a full set of specialized tools yet, so I’m always hunting for ideas on what I can safely improvise at home. Sometimes builders just say, “use this tool,” without suggesting alternatives.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Visual Guidance for Tiny Details – Close-up photos of knots, fittings, and small deck pieces are surprisingly rare. YouTube videos often skip over the tiny bits because the camera can’t capture them well, and written manuals assume perfect eyesight and hands.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Step-by-Step Problem Solving – When something goes wrong—like a mast that won’t sit straight or a rope that twists oddly—it’s hard to find beginner-level troubleshooting. Experienced builders sometimes fix things without showing the process, which leaves me guessing.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Patience <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a beginner builder, I want to see that perfection is not necessary, so that I can get encouragement to continue.">Encouragement</span> – Oddly enough, I wish there were more resources that remind beginners it’s okay to take time and make mistakes. I sometimes feel overwhelmed when I see perfect builds online and compare myself.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">So, in short, I can find plenty of expert-level stuff, but the beginner-focused, hand-holding kind of guidance is much harder to track down.</div>
                <p class="question mt-3">Tell me about a positive experience you’ve had either online or offline when interacting with other model ship builders? What do you think made it positive?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3">
one of the most positive experiences I’ve had was on a small Facebook group for model ship beginners. I had just received my Occre Albatros kit, and I was completely overwhelmed by all the tiny parts and unfamiliar terms. I posted a photo of my first attempt at the deck planking and admitted that I was totally lost.                </div>
                <div class="response mt-3">
Within a few hours, several members replied with step-by-step suggestions, and one even made a short video showing how they started the same part. They were patient, encouraging, and didn’t make me feel silly for asking “basic” questions. One person even shared a tip about using a pair of tweezers and a folded piece of cardboard to guide the planks, which made a huge difference for me.                    </div>
                <div class="response mt-3">
What made it positive was the welcoming attitude and the fact that people were genuinely helpful without being judgmental. It wasn’t about showing off their own skills—it was about supporting someone who’s just starting out. That sense of encouragement really boosted my confidence and made me excited to keep going.                    </div>
            <p class="question mt-3">When you are looking for resources related to model ship building, which device do you primarily use, and how to you use it?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">these days I mostly use my <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model builder, I need a tablet friendly website so that I can use the website without a mouse while I'm working on a build.">tablet</span> when I’m looking for model ship resources. I like that I can prop it up right next to my workspace, so I can glance at instructions or a video while I’m handling tiny pieces. It’s easy to zoom in on photos, pause videos, or scroll through tutorials without having to get up or fumble with a mouse.</div>    
            <div class="response mt-3">I do use my laptop sometimes, especially if I want to read forum threads or download PDFs of instructions, because the bigger screen makes it easier to see the details. But for hands-on guidance, the tablet is my go-to.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">I rarely use my phone for this stuff—the screen is just too small to see knots, planks, or detailed diagrams clearly.</div>
            <p class="question mt-3">What is something you wish that non model ship builders knew about you and your hobby?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">what I wish non–model ship builders knew is that this hobby isn’t just about making a tiny ship to put on a shelf. For me, it’s deeply personal and kind of romantic—I grew up hearing stories from my dad about sailing, and building a tall ship like the Albatros lets me connect with that world in a hands-on way.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">I also wish people understood how much learning and patience it takes, especially for a first-timer like me. Every plank, knot, and rigging line is a challenge, and I spend hours figuring out techniques, names of parts, and even how to use tools I don’t yet own. It’s not just “crafting a model,” it’s learning a whole new skill set from scratch.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">And finally, I wish people realized how rewarding it is. Even a small victory—like getting a mast straight or successfully tying my first proper knot—feels like an accomplishment. It’s not about speed or perfection; it’s about the process and the connection to something I’ve romanticized for years.</div>
        <p class="question mt-3">Is there anything about your hobby of model ship building that you feel needs to be kept confidential or discrete?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">honestly, there’s not much I feel I need to keep secret. I’m proud of my Albatros build, and I enjoy talking about it with friends or showing photos online</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">The only things I tend to keep a bit private are:</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">Mistakes and Missteps – Sometimes I mess up a plank or knot, and it takes a few tries to fix it. I don’t always want to broadcast every little disaster, because it can look messy to someone who doesn’t understand the process.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">Costs and Impulse Buys – Since I’m just starting, I’ve bought a few kits, tools, and materials on a whim. I don’t usually advertise how much I spend because some people might think it’s excessive, even though it’s all part of learning and enjoying the hobby.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">Beyond that, I don’t really feel the need for secrecy. Sharing my journey online or with other beginners is actually helpful, because I often get tips or encouragement in return.</div>

    <section class="interview">
                <h5 class="user-name">Gene/Jean
                </h5>
                <p class="initial-prompt mt-1">Gene/Jean is 17, is very shy, and mostly spends time at home with their family. They have always been obsessed with trains and have built over one hundred model trains of increasing complexity over the years. Recently they visited the Fram Museum in Oslo during a family trip and they are now developing an obsession with water travel and want to build their first model ship.</p>
                <p class="question mt-3">When you go online to find information about model ship building, what types of interactions or information are you looking for?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Oh… um, okay. So when I go online to look up model ship building stuff, I guess I’m kind of hoping for a few specific things. I get nervous posting in forums or comment sections, so I mostly just read quietly. But here’s what I look for:</div>
<div class="response mt-3">Clear, Step-by-Step Guides
I really like tutorials that break things down into small parts—like how to shape the hull, or what kind of glue works best for wood versus plastic.
Diagrams help a lot. Especially ones that show cross-sections or rigging layouts. I save those to a folder and stare at them forever.</div>
    <div class="response mt-3">Tool and Material Recommendations
I don’t always know what tools I need, so I look for lists from people who’ve built ships before. Like, “You’ll need a pin vise, tweezers, and this specific kind of paint.”

I also check reviews to see if a certain brand of miniature rope frays too easily or if a kit is beginner-friendly.</div>
        
<div class="response mt-3">Build Logs and Progress Photos
These are my favorite. When someone posts pictures of their ship coming together over time, it’s like watching a story unfold.

I learn a lot from seeing how people fix mistakes or improvise when something doesn’t fit right.</div>
    
<div class="response mt-3">Quiet, Supportive Communities
I lurk in places like model ship forums or Reddit threads. I don’t post much, but I read everything.

I like when people are kind and patient with beginners. It makes me feel like maybe I could ask a question someday.</div>
    
    
<div class="response mt-3"><span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model builder, I want information on the history of the models we build so that I feel more connected to what I am building.">Historical Context</span>
Since I saw the Fram, I’ve been obsessed with polar exploration. So I look for info about the real ships—what they were made of, how they were designed to survive ice, stuff like that.

It helps me imagine the story behind the model I’m building.</div>
    
    
<div class="response mt-3">I guess I’m trying to learn without feeling overwhelmed. I want to build something that feels real, like it could’ve sailed through a storm or drifted through ice floes. That’s probably weird, huh…</div>
    
                <p class="question mt-3">Is there any information, or are there any experiences, about model ship building that you have difficulty finding online?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3 p-x-3">Yeah… actually, there are a few things I’ve had trouble finding. It’s kind of frustrating sometimes, especially when I feel like I’m almost understanding something but not quite. Here’s what I wish was easier to find:</div>
                    
<div class="response mt-3">Beginner-Friendly Ship Plans
Most of the plans I find are either super basic (like for kids) or really advanced, with naval architecture terms I don’t understand yet.

I wish there were more middle-ground plans—like, detailed enough to feel real, but not so complex that I need a degree in engineering to follow them.</div>
    
<div class="response mt-3">Rigging Tutorials That Don’t Assume You Already Know Everything
Rigging is… confusing. There are so many lines and knots and terms like “shrouds” and “ratlines” and “deadeyes” and I just stare at diagrams like 😵‍💫.

I’ve found some videos, but they either go too fast or skip steps. I’d love a slow, patient walkthrough with close-ups and explanations of why each part matters.</div>
    
<div class="response mt-3">Mistake Recovery Advice
With trains, if I mess up a wheel or a coupling, I kind of know how to fix it. But with ships, if I glue something wrong or snap a mast, I don’t know what to do.

I haven’t found many people talking about how to fix things when they go wrong. It’s always perfect builds, and that makes me nervous to even start.</div>
    
<div class="response mt-3">Quiet Personal Stories
I like reading about how people got into ship modeling—what inspired them, what their first build was like, what they struggled with.

But those <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a model builder, I want to hear personal stories from other builders, so that I can feel connected.">stories</span> are kind of rare. Most posts are just “Here’s my finished model!” and not “Here’s what I learned while messing up five times.”</div>
    
<div class="response mt-3">Affordable Material Alternatives
Some kits and tools are really expensive. I’ve been trying to find ways to substitute things—like using embroidery thread for rigging or repurposing old wood scraps.

But there’s not much info about budget-friendly building. I wish more people shared their hacks.</div>
<div class="response mt-3">I guess I’m looking for a space where it’s okay to be new and unsure and curious. Where people talk about the process, not just the polished result. That’s what I try to do with my trains, and I want to feel that way about ships too.

Sorry if that was a lot. I just… think about this stuff a lot.</div>
    
                <p class="question mt-3">Tell me about a positive experience you’ve had either online or offline when interacting with other model ship builders? What do you think made it positive?</p>
                <div class="response mt-3">
Honestly, the best experience I’ve had was when I finally worked up the courage to post a question about rigging on a small ship-model forum. Someone replied with a step-by-step photo guide—showing exactly how to tie each knot, how tight to pull the line, and even how to secure loose ends without fraying. They answered every follow-up politely, never made me feel dumb for asking, and encouraged me to share progress photos so they could help troubleshoot. It was the first time I felt like I truly belonged in a ship-building community.</div>                
<div class="response mt-3">
What made it positive:Clear, patient explanations that broke the process into tiny steps

Real-time feedback on my mistakes, with photos of how they fixed the same errors on their own builds

Encouragement to keep trying (“Every master was once a beginner,” they said)

A genuinely kind tone—no sarcasm or gatekeeping</div>
            <p class="question mt-3">When you are looking for resources related to model ship building, which device do you primarily use, and how to you use it?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">
                I usually turn to my laptop first. It’s got the biggest screen and enough power to run multiple tabs, PDFs, and picture folders all at once. Here’s how I use it when I’m hunting for ship-building resources:</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">Browsing tutorials and forums I keep several browser tabs open: one for step-by-step guides, another for build logs or forum threads, and a third for supplier sites so I can check prices and specs.

Viewing and annotating plans I download PDF ship plans, open them in a lightweight reader, then use the highlight tool or a free drawing app to mark hull lines or note mast positions.

Organizing bookmarks and screenshots I create a “Ship Project” folder where I save screenshots of rigging diagrams or tool lists, then rename each file so I can find it later—like “bow-shape.jpg” or “pin-vise-tips.png.”</div>
                
            <div class="response mt-3">Sometimes I’ll switch to my phone if I’m away from my desk:</div>

<div class="response mt-3">Quick look-ups in the workshop I’ll pull up a rigging knot video on YouTube to replay just the part I need, or check a forum thread photo while I’m leaning over my workbench.

Messaging people If I do build up the nerve to ask a question, I’ll draft it in notes first, then copy-paste into Reddit or Discord on my phone. It feels more private that way.</div>
            <p class="question mt-3">What is something you wish that non model ship builders knew about you and your hobby?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">I wish folks understood that model ship building isn’t just a weekend craft or a dusty display—it’s a genuine engineering puzzle and a meditative escape all at once. Every plank I shape, every spar I rig, demands patience, focus, and a steady hand. When that tiny brass eyebolt lines up perfectly, it feels like unlocking a small miracle.</div>
                
            <div class="response mt-3">Building ships also lets me step into history’s shoes. Planking the Fram model isn’t just gluing wood—it’s retracing Nansen’s and Amundsen’s footsteps across frozen seas. Each plank becomes a page in their adventure. I wish people could see how much research, imagination, and storytelling fuel every stage of the build.</div>

                
        <p class="question mt-3">Is there anything about your hobby of model ship building that you feel needs to be kept confidential or discrete?</p>
            <div class="response mt-3">Hmm… I guess I wouldn’t say it needs to be confidential, but there are parts I tend to keep quiet about. Not because I’m ashamed or anything—it’s just that most people don’t really get it, and I don’t always feel like explaining.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">Like… sometimes I talk to my models. Not out loud (well, maybe a whisper), but I imagine the crew, the captain, the weather they’re sailing through. I give them names. I write little backstories in my notebook. It’s not just building—it’s <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="As a boat lover, I want a safe space for storytelling so that I can enjoy this aspect of model building, not just the practical considerations.">storytelling</span>. But if I told someone at school that I spent Saturday night deciding whether my tiny ship should brave a storm off Cape Horn or wait it out in a fjord… they’d probably laugh.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">Also, I keep my workspace kind of hidden. It’s in the corner of the garage, behind the bikes and old camping gear. I like it that way. It’s quiet, and no one interrupts me. I don’t post pictures of my builds online unless I’m really proud of them, and even then, I crop out the background so people don’t see how cluttered it is.</div>
            <div class="response mt-3">So yeah… it’s not that it has to be secret. It’s just mine. And I like it that way.</div>
